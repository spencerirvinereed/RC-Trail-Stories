Marketing will continue to sell things

In life, when is it we are crossing the line,\
A little enhancement or lot of enhancement

Early in life, go for the maximum

Now later in life, no longer need the best.

Just enough to do the job and maybe a little extra

Not the loudest speakers or deepest bass but enough sound

Perhaps combine several small radios to match one big speaker

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transition from maximum level to minimum level that satisfies.

That is what is the minimal sound level that I can detect rather than what is the maximum level before distortion kicks in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoping to learn from the Japanese, their secret

The secret turned out to be hard work and target.

No tolerance, just meet the specification

Toyota people kindly telling US visitors.

Instead of learning how we do things, why don't you come up with solutions that meet your needs.

Hence Kata.
