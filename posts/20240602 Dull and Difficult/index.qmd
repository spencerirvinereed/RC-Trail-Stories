## Importance of no labels

I am that I am

Something that can be named belongs in that sphere created.

Things that can be named is not the Way.

Labels are at times necessary in this life.but at times it draws too much unnecessary attention.

A challenge for medical device companies and its product is to more good than harm.

Once introduced a new label and coined a term that describe the challenge of inserting a metal cannula and a plastic catheter into a vein.it was named, 

`Dull and Difficult` (better suited as a movie title or to describe somone)

It became a lightning rod for pent up complaints.Some were ready to place blame on something, now they had a target. 

Both the label change and the description of the issue, compounded their complaints.For a while, we needed a daily meeting to handle all of the complaints.

Life as an immigrant is not easy. Almost a weekly reminder that you are different than locals. Sometimes verbal sometimes non-verbal, they both served as reminder that I am differnt.Most of the time I brushed it off and it didn't help for someone trying to fit in Good thing I was busy learning.Helped to have a loving, supportive family. Re-inforced by a community of gospel-living saints.Made it through the education system. One include segregation via busing.

Fast forward 5 years removed from the graduation. I am living near Western and Olympic. The skyline of downtown LA is visible.People around me are mostly Koreans. Next major block, Pico Blvd, Hispanics I-10 is a hard dividing line. We seldom ventured south of Olympic,Our area consisted of Vermont to the East Crenshaw to the West Beverly on the North Pico to the SouthOur daily visits (tracking) was centered in and around the Wishire Blvd.It was a great experience to see other Koreans that had immigrated to US. Seeing how they adjust, how some have lost their ways. The role of Korean churches, mainly as social network, providing necessities to immigrants. A sense of belonging and proving temporal welfare, shelter, food, job assistance.I didn't feel as lonely.

Fast forward another 15 years. I am back to where we start our journey as a family I am in Korea 25 years after leavingI am married, have children, and have a role and mission to complete in 4 years.I am an ex-pat in the country of birth.I look like others, I talk mostly like others, sans the local accent. However, Koreans are able to pick out the small differences and let me know.- We don't use those expressions anymore, that is old Korean- How come you don't drink with us after workLooking back they were just commenting on the difference, in a straight foward, Korean way of wecoing someone.I have learned to accept it and move onHaving a family with me and the local congregation 수겅 황드 helped.

This year marks 50 years in US. Have seen many changesWhen I arrived no one knew where Korea was Except those that associated with the Korean War.Now nearly everyone know something about the Korean Wave.I have not changedI am still trying to understand and adapt. Adept and grow in this environmentLabels and packaging are important My company learned a hard lesson.I learned a soft lesson Stick to your basics and instinct to survive But also rely on your heritage
