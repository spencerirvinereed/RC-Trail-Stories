We live in the southwest corner of an area, a block, known as the `Upper U`.
(Developers made a mirror-imaged area called the `Lower U`, separated by a north-south through street.)

There are 2 dozen homes that form a mini-neighborhood.

Everyone is known by the neighbors and we recognize and greet one another
Occasionally taking time to catch up on family whereabouts.

Most have raised their children and are either enjoying or looking forward to the relaxing or continuing the servicing part of their lives.

The `Upper U` decided to throw a block party around the Labor Day Weekend.

Hosts provided the main meal, pulled pork sandwich and the Texas styled pork beans.
Everyone one invited to bring salad and desserts and they fulfilled their assignments.

Self organizing at its best.

Food was laid out in the familiar and efficient manner.
Main offering, past salads, followed by dinner rolls and desserts.

Seating, provided by patio furniture and additional folding chairs was grouped into 4 and 6 person
This encouraged free flowing discussions.

Growing up, gatherings with my peers would make me nervous.
Inevitable comparison of apparent wealth, social status, educational achievements would highlight the gap.

We are all travelling towards the same destination.

The path and experiences are unique and custom made to help us prepare.
For the return to the place of beginning.
To give account of our use of resources and talents.

Everyone shared life's challenges and aspirations.
For the duration of the evening we were all equal and manifested our love and respect for another.
The status of Union, economic uncertainty, wars and rumors of war were bit more distant.

A couple handed in their resignation or retired within the week.
Their plan was to travel to Europe, set their lives in order and then continue to serve in the mission field.

Resolute and admirable.

> “They have become free forever … to act for themselves and not to be acted upon” (2 Nephi 2:26).

My parents bought the home we live in, as their retirement home.
They lived out their earthly lives in gratitude and among their friends and family.
We were able to share in the living arrangements and take part in their lives.

Told my neighbors at the gathering, sometimes we don't belong in this same neighborhood since our paths to Zion is different.

However, as we think through the lives of parents and grandparents, and see the Providence, perhaps it is time we can contemplate and stop running like refugees and work like immigrants.

>25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.
27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

- Matthew 25

Thank you mom and dad for providing the earthly means and giving us a glimpse of next life.

All in wisdom and love and in due time.
