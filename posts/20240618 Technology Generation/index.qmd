My home in Korea had in-door water.

But we had outhouse.

This was considered progress

These are instances of progresses

Chronological vs Technological Age

My parents lives are better aligned with a generation before in US.

My generation also started late but have caught up.

Future generation start at a higher level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, not all changes are progress

Likewise, progresses are due to changes.

At times it is more important to know what to keep things as is.

Know what the original intent.

My grandmother was born after the last Korean king abdicated.

My father first saw car and ran up the hill.

Now days I am scared of the new technology

Which generation had to change most.

Not just age but amount of technology change.

2 generation change is difficult to gap.
