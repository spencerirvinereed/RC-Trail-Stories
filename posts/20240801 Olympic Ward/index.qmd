Sister **C** said, during one of our visits.

>The world is frightening, I wish, I had not brought children into it

I was considerably younger than her, without experiences, those words had a lasting impact.

Sister **C** was an artist, her focus was watercolor.
Her subjects were modernized, Korean themes.
She had recently moved to LA, Koreatown from NYC.

She was introduced to us by a Sister from NYC, that owned an ice cream shop near West 3rd Street and Normandie.

We would visit her regularly and she was cordial.
At times, we weren't sure who was teaching and who was learning.
She certainly had more knowledge and experience.

We stayed inside during the night hours.
But we could hear the sound of guns and would often see police helicoptors with a search light fly overhead.

Also there were many grafitti markings where we walked.

So when she made the comment about the state of the world, I wondered what would be the right response.

I didn't have any.

Now, nearly 40 years later, I have a greater appreciation of the remark but still no satisfying answer.

The surprising movie from last year was `Gozilla Minus One`
It had engaging story telling and attractive, relatable casts.

In addition, the post WW2, neighborhood scene transition from a temporary housing to a more semi-permanent brought back memories.

My parents lived through the Korean War as a 20-year-old soldier and as an 18-year-old eldest daughter of a fatherless family.

After the War, their living conditions must have beeen like the one from the Godzilla movie.

Within 10 years from the end of the Korean War, 3 children would join the family.  
My parents followed this, the first commandment given,

>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, 
Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it:...

Korean proverb says,

>아이들은 자기 먹을 것 가지고 태어난다

Literally, Children are born with their own food.
Alternately, Children are born with the means to survive in this world.

I would like to meet Sister **C** and her children again and see how their lives turned out.
Also thank my parents were bringing my sisters and I into this world at a time when most temporal items were scarce and hope for the future was slim.

Leaving us an example of how to overcome the trials in this life.

They put their trust in God who created all things and promised us

>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
