Growing up I was confused by 2 similar sounding words in Korean.

귀환 (返回) and 귀한 (寶貴的)

When someone said, he/she is a returned missionary.

I interpreted it to mean, "he/she is a valuable missionary" and who made that determination?

I worked in Los Angeles area, as a Korean speaking missionary.

We have all been elevated by experiences yet we forget or the impact lessens as years, days and hours go by.
