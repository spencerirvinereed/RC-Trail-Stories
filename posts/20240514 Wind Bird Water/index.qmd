Began as a physical exercise.

Before work, a hike to a nearby by canyon.

Evolved into a glimpse into nature with its changes.

A different offerings seasonally, as well as the time of the day.

Confirming the Greek philosopher Heraclitus' quote,

> **Everything changes and nothing remains still; and you cannot step twice into the same stream**

Each hike is different than the one before, even on the same path, at the same hour.

Because the Canyon offers a combination of flowing water, singing birds or flowing breeze.

Sounds one can hear but also feel.

These seemingly same or similar scenes, gradually transforms persons.

Reshaped by the ever changing yet complete or whole environment.

Close to man-made developments yet a representation of another world.

Human developments and education teaches by addition.

Building upon knowledge, a little by little.

Nature seems to teaches by subtraction, removing, healing, and restoring things and souls to what they once were.

With that newly created space, one can wonder, ask questions and receive answers in the form of vista-inspired messages or recollections of past events.

As the feet wanders, the mind seems to be shaped and sharpened, perhaps by the mechanics of movement. Clearing away the human generated understanding and replacing it with the natural and lasting thoughts and feelings about life and our place in the world.

Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?

It is empty, but lacks nothing.

The more it moves, the more comes out of it.

The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows, it is empty but does not collapse; it moves and more and more issues.
