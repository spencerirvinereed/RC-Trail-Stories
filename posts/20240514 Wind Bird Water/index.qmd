Began as a physical exercise.

Before work, a hike to a nearby by canyon.

Evolved into a glimpse into nature and its changes.

A seasonal offerings, the time of the day, at first not noticed and not appreciated.

Challenging yet confirming daily the Greek philosopher Heraclitus' quote,

> **Everything changes and nothing remains still; and you cannot step twice into the same stream**

## Flowing Air

Each hike is different than the one before, even on the same path, at the same hour.

Because the Canyon offers a combination of flowing water, singing birds or flowing breeze. Sounds one can hear and also feel. In the morning, the canyon feels as if a chilled oxygen tank has been opened.

These seemingly same or similar scenes, gradually transforms persons. As a person takes a step forward and upward, it seems to remove or empty terrestrial items.

The emptied mind is replaced with recollections of the past, appreciation for the people in one's life, and a hope in the change that will make one complete or whole.

Human developments and education teaches by addition. 
Building upon knowledge, a little by little.

Nature teaches by subtraction, removing, healing, and at times restoring. 
Things and memories to the soul, returning to a place and restoring souls to as they were.

With that newly created space, one can wonder, ask questions and receive answers in the form of vista-inspired messages or recollections of past events.

As the feet wanders, the mind seems to be shaped and sharpened, perhaps by the mechanics of movement.

Filtering away misconceptions and complementing the human generated understanding. And if necessary, replacing it with the natural and lasting thoughts And positive feelings about life and our place in the world.

> Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?\
> It is empty, but lacks nothing.\
> The more it moves, the more comes out of it.
