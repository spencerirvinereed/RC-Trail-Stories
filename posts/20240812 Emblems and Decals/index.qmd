Saw a 3D decal that I hadn't seen in years.

The emblem was on a car from the previous century.

The car was in mint condition, almost like it spent some time away from Utah then came back.

Seeing the fish emblem brought backmemories from decades ago.

Specifically, Los Angeles area during the 1980s.

Many cars had the Fish or IXOYE logos emblazoned on the back of their cars.

In addition, Christian homes displayed the stickers from their churches.

Saw plenty of yellow and red, Oriental Mission Church or 동양선교교회 (東洋宣教教会), on the front door of apartments.

As we worked in the west part of town, we saw `mezuzahs`[^1]

We then realized we had drifted too far from our work area.

When we worked the Echo Park and Silver Lake areas, we would see names on the mailbox that were longer than we are used to seeing.

We had difficulty pronouncing them, but through experience, we knew we were among Armenians.

Towards the end of my stay in LA, I knew the area, without even checking the names on the mailbox or looking for religious emblems.

I had gone through most areas, at least 3 times each.

During the Covid, the company was ready to scale back the mask protocol.

On condition that individuals take the vaccine and the exchange ID lanyard from grey to orange color.

This would signify that one accepted and let others know.

Most people signed up for that option immediately.

Not my next door colleague.

He had a grandparent who was a Jew.

The labeling or separating groups by designation was a significant, non-negotiable part of his heritage.

In my early years, I thought it would be a good idea to signify one's religion or association with a group by wearing a pin or some type of emblem in public

No longer feel it is necessary.

We have the most sure and unique identification — our countenance.

The world, through resumes and curriculum vitae, asks for proof of work or capability.

Our family and acquaintances knows us and recognizes our ups and downs based on our countenances.

Furthermore, it is not what we possess or seem to understand but how little we were affected by the things of this world.

That our countenances reflect our belief, commitment and exercise of the core meaning of the phrase.
