Koreans like to hike mountains.
There are fashionable outfits and clubs of all types to accommodate all levels of hikers.

For older Koreans, going to mountains is more than a hike.

My mother-in-law loved mountains. 
Especially in spring time when wild vegetation yields some of the best harvest of fresh vegetable.

Recall, climbing mountains around Provo and Sandy searching for these plants.
It seems they are almost cultivated, since they are confined to certain locations year after year
Fond recollection of carrying an empty trash bag up. Then harvesting a bag or two full of 취나물[^1] or 고사리^[https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B3%A0%EC%82%AC%EB%A6%AC]

These are considered delicacies and enhances 비빔밥^[https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%B9%84%EB%B9%94%EB%B0%A5]. 

In fact, there is a strong demand for these items harvested from mountains.

In later years, her arthritis prevented her from returning to these coveted places.

Older Koreans also prefer, indirect communications, when given a choice between direct and indirect.

It may not be the most efficient means of communication, but at times there seems to be a competition of saying the most distant message and still getting the message across.

Art of speaking indirectly, involves,
Making an observation. Checking if the person is in tune.

> Here are some debris around this dumpster.

- Response of a novice
-> What! of course there are debris around dumpster.

- Intermediate level response
-> Oh it's an issue, I will get to it when I have some time

- Enlightened Response
-> I got this, I am on it

Captured in these exchanges, may reveal the following

- How well do we notice the subtlety and in congruence of the statement?
- Is there an issue, hidden in the statement of fact, to be understood and resolved
- Is it my responsibility and if so, when will I get to it.

The reaction to the statement of the fact determines the level of listener.
My parent's generation, especially was adept at this.

Glad that she made an indirect request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One day, mother–in-law mentioned,

> Wonder what the view of the valley would be from a location on the mountain?

We didn't understand her words initially.

We had wished, can she be more direct, for

> direct communication is the quickest and a surest way to communicate
> It is if the message delivery is to maximized for efficiency.

Finally understood that she wanted to climb the Y-Mountain.
It became our issue to resolve and we arranged a time to do it as a family.

We had to figure out a way to get her up on the trail and climb to the 6266 feet level from the 5164 feet starting point[^2]

Various ideas

-   Take turns carrying her on our backs
-   Garden trailer
-   Gurney or stretcher

Finally settled on the combo bike trailer, made as a children stroller.

The team was assembled on an early May morning.

Fifteen of her descendants pushed and pulled her up to the top of the letter Y.

With the passing of that generation of Koreans, we are losing the knowledge and preparation of edible mountain provided vegetables.

Perhaps, it is to be expected, since most substitute items are available either locally or through mail-order. 

More directly, the hunger and the need to live off nature's offering is no longer necessary.

However, the joy of carrying around a sack and a chance to harvest may need to be rediscovered by future generations.

Grateful for the patience of the past generation.

For teaching us that direct communication is not always most effective.
There are times, one needs to shield the young generation, until they are capable on their own.

Want to thank that generation for showing how to live (survive) and thrive, by relying on the source of all Providences.
