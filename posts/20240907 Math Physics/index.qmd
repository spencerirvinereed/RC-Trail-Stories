A colleague mentioned that his friend is Bragg BRAGG I have not heard that name for a quite a while although I do recall from the physics class at College about Brad's angle I work with many PhD's

I wonder at times how I got things done looking back at Northrop Grumman days we produced fiber optic Jireh-based navigation system that supported ground-based interceptor the program is called EKP which stands for XR atmospheric kill vehicle but the more common used to the acronym was employee kill vehicle

At the twilight the creator career I have been blessed I don't me have I worked in multiple fields but a chance to visit many countries in locale but I've also had a chance to work with wonderful people and make some contribution

Found a way that will disprove the writer of the Ecclesiastes who said

> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

New international version Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse nine

If true there is no need for social news services SNS Furthermore there are no need for learning nor schools and even jobs

I will call when I buy electrical engineering professors that said at most you utilize concepts and principles from two or three classes in your daily work you just don't know which one of those classes

What up why I believe professor minor was correct the value and the justification for education is more than knowledge gathering knowledge repository that leads to a marketable skill.

At work there is an electronic vault labelled `Engineering Library`. It is a network directory, filed under the drive `COMMON`

Found a paper by Mulcahy and ??? High Voltage And Electrical Insulation Engineering funded by the government.

What was their research like? What challenges did they face? What was their reward? What is their legacy

Within its 2 dozen or so directories are works of past scientists and engineers. Works that have pioneered the field of X Ray generation and detection.

In essense engineer, direct, guide light.

If the writers of a crazy Ecclesiastes was correct we would all be out of work and artificial intelligence could continue our work because all things have been done prior to our arrival what that is our contract contribution to the work civilization Ecclesiastes writer helps us again in this

Well he speaks of the limits of human knowledge and achievement he also speaks of the fear of God and keeping his commandments as in Ecclesiastes chapter 1213 suggesting that the reverence and trust in God provide the only real foundation for a meaningful life although human wisdom and pursuits are limited faith in God offers a way to chance transcend the uncertainties in hardships of life

> Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind.

NIV, Ecclesiates 12:13

According to the Internet Rabbi Manis

    What are 2 things that perhaps a person can do to

-   00:07

    find answers or find for himself or herself

-   00:12

    a connection to a higher power

-   00:13

    or the purpose for their life?

-   00:16

    The first thing is you have freedom of choice.

-   00:20

    And the choice you need to make is a very simple one.

    You can be needy.

-   00:28

    You can be needed.

-   00:31

    That's it. That's what it boils down to.

-   00:34

    You can focus on your needs, try to satisfy your needs,

-   00:37

    pursue your needs, do it your way, whatever that means,

-   00:45

    and you're gonna get depressed.

-   00:49

    Or you can focus on who needs you.

-   00:54

    We exist because we are needed.

-   00:58

    That's who we are. We are necessary.

Based on my life and experiences in the field of Medical Device Industry and Aerospace Industry. I believe in this,

> Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

The Book of **Ecclesiastes** in the Bible explores deep philosophical questions about the meaning of life, the human condition, and the pursuit of happiness. Its overall theme revolves around the **futility** of worldly pursuits and the **inevitability of death**, while still encouraging people to find joy and purpose in life’s simple pleasures and in a relationship with God. The book is often seen as contemplative and somber, offering wisdom through reflection on life’s fleeting nature.

### Key Themes

1.  **The Vanity of Life ("Hebel")**:
    -   One of the central themes of Ecclesiastes is the Hebrew word "hebel," often translated as "vanity" or "meaningless." The author, often called the **Preacher** or **Teacher** (traditionally associated with King Solomon), repeatedly states that everything in life is **temporary** and **ultimately futile**. Human efforts—whether in work, wealth, wisdom, or pleasure—cannot provide lasting fulfillment because everything is subject to decay and death.
    -   **“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity”** (Ecclesiastes 1:2) captures this idea that all human endeavors, no matter how grand, are fleeting in the face of time and mortality.
2.  **The Limits of Human Knowledge and Achievement**:
    -   The book emphasizes the **limits of human wisdom and understanding**. Despite humanity's search for meaning, there is much that remains unknowable, especially regarding the nature of life, death, and God’s plans.
    -   The Preacher reflects on the **pursuit of wisdom**, **pleasure**, and **work**, concluding that none of these can bring ultimate satisfaction, as everyone eventually dies, whether wise or foolish.
3.  **The Inevitability of Death**:
    -   Death is portrayed as the great equalizer. No matter one’s status, achievements, or wisdom, **all humans share the same fate—death**. This recurring theme challenges the notion that material success or wisdom can give life lasting meaning.
4.  **Enjoyment of Simple Pleasures**:
    -   Despite the recognition of life’s futility, Ecclesiastes offers a **positive message** about finding joy in the **present**. The Preacher encourages people to enjoy simple pleasures—food, drink, work, family, and relationships—acknowledging them as gifts from God.
    -   **“There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy their work”** (Ecclesiastes 2:24). This suggests that, while life may not offer ultimate answers, one can still find meaning in the present moment.
5.  **The Fear of God**:
    -   The book concludes by urging readers to **fear God and keep His commandments** (Ecclesiastes 12:13), suggesting that reverence and trust in God provide the only real foundation for a meaningful life. Although human wisdom and pursuits are limited, **faith in God** offers a way to transcend the uncertainties and hardships of life.

### The Message of Ecclesiastes

The Book of Ecclesiastes delivers a message of **humility** and **realism** about human existence. Its overarching message is that life’s ultimate meaning cannot be found in earthly achievements, pleasures, or wisdom. Instead, it directs readers to acknowledge the **fragility of life**, accept its limitations, and find peace in living a life of reverence and trust in God.

At its core, the book is about finding contentment in the moment, recognizing life’s transience, and understanding that fulfillment is only truly found in the **eternal perspective of God's plan**, rather than in temporary human endeavors.
