Since moving to the main trail from the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, been meeting people I recognize.

Patty, Paul, Marvin, Jeff, Grant

Met them but could not remember their names right away. Fortunately, it came back to mind

> Retirement is not overated. - Paul

Paul read a book on how 2 Jewish families in Shanghai and Hong Kong helped establish the modern China.

Grant goes up with Marvin.

After finishing, goes back up and brings down Paul, who is slowing down.
