**손자/孫子**

Hi Grandpa, what are you working on?

**Older Me**

Putting together a remembrance book for the 100th Anniversary of the D-Day.

**손자/孫子**

It is bit confusing, D-Day, VE Day, VJ Day, and the Memorial Day.

Plus they don't teach about these at school anymore, the more recent events take precedence.

It is difficult to relate to an event, that no one in the family participated.

Besides, aren't most people dead that took part in it?

**Older Me**

It is true that no one in the family were directly involved in the D-Day Invasion, however, we have had family members that served the country in the military.

Do you remember Great Grandfather H's service?

What about Great Grandfather K's service in the Korean War.

We will get to why it is important to remember these seemingly irrelevant, outdated events.

**손자/孫子**

Mom talked about Grandfather K's battles in the Korean War.

How he was captured by the North Koreans. A POW 3 times and each time he was able to escape with the help of the Almighty.

What was that quote by the commanding North Korean officer?

좋은 나인대, 세월을 잘못선택...

Something about good age but bad timing...

**Older Me**

Good recollection, mom taught you well.

He along with other young people in their 20s battled the forces of Communist power.

As is the case, the people that paid the ultimate sacrifice were commoners, that did not fully understand the reason for the war.

Nevertheless, they answered and fought the enemy, in some cases, brother against brother, former neighbors against new neighbors.

What was the reason for the Korean War, or for that matter, any other wars.

**손자/孫子**

AI lists following reasons, among others. (see, @sec-conflicts)

-   Ideological Conflicts
-   Ethnic and Religious Tensions
-   Nationalism

Is this what you had in mind? I am glad we no longer have conflicts on the scale that your generation and previous generations experienced.

**Older Me**

A good summary.

I believe the root of all conflict is to assert unrighteous dominance and to take away god given freedom. (see @sec-dnc)

> We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion

As far as the absence of inter-national, or intra-national conflicts, I believe they are on-going and ever will be.

As long as people or persons want to eliminate God and family and exercise unrighteous dominion over others, there will be wars, fought physically or spiritually.

We are shielded from internal struggles or burdens of each generation but we will all experience these on-going conflicts.

**손자/孫子**

What then is our defense?\
Do we go on the offense?

**Older Me**

Let's read the 6th Chapter of the Epistle of Paul to Ephesians.

10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

13 Wherefore take unto you the `whole armour of God`, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

14 Stand therefore, having your `loins girt about with truth`, and having on the `breastplate of righteousness`;

15 And your `feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace`;

16 Above all, `taking the shield of faith`, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

17 And take the `helmet of salvation`, and the `sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God`:

The arrangement of battles and its players may look different. However, the challenge has been and will be to separate the good and the evil and cling to those principles, or laws and commandments that saved other generations.

**손자/孫子**

Thanks Grandpa. I am beginning to understand what you are saying.

It is our challenge to make old things new again. Make fresh commitments or covenants and to meet, fight, and vanquish the current brand of evil.

All with help from God above and following examples of past generations.

Gotta go, but what was that D-Day all about?[^1]

## Appendix 1 {#sec-conflicts}

The 20th century saw numerous wars driven by a variety of complex factors. Here are some of the primary reasons for these conflicts:

1.  **Nationalism**: The rise of nationalistic fervor led to aggressive expansionist policies and conflicts. This was especially evident in the Balkan Wars, World War I, and World War II, where nationalist ambitions fueled territorial disputes and ambitions for empire-building.

2.  **Imperialism and Colonial Rivalries**: European powers competed for control over territories and resources, leading to tensions and conflicts in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. The struggle for colonies often resulted in confrontations and wars between imperial powers.

3.  **Ideological Conflicts**: The 20th century was marked by ideological battles, particularly between democracy, fascism, and communism. The most significant examples include World War II, where fascist regimes sought to dominate, and the Cold War, where the ideological conflict between the capitalist West and communist East led to proxy wars and significant global tension.

4.  **Economic Factors**: Economic instability, competition for resources, and the impact of the Great Depression contributed to conflicts. Nations sought to secure resources and markets, leading to aggressive foreign policies and war.

5.  **Treaty and Alliance Systems**: Complex networks of treaties and alliances often escalated conflicts. For example, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 led to World War I due to a web of alliances and mutual defense agreements.

6.  **Ethnic and Religious Tensions**: Many wars were fueled by ethnic and religious differences, leading to internal and regional conflicts. The Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s and various conflicts in the Middle East are examples where ethnic and religious divisions played a significant role.

7.  **Revolution and Civil Wars**: Revolutions and internal strife often escalated into broader conflicts. The Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, the Chinese Civil War, and numerous independence movements and revolutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were driven by the desire for political and social change.

8.  **Technological and Military Advancements**: The rapid development of military technology and strategies often made war more likely, as nations sought to test new capabilities and gain military superiority. This arms race was particularly evident during the Cold War, leading to various confrontations and proxy wars.

Each of these factors contributed to the numerous and varied conflicts of the 20th century, making it one of the most war-torn periods in human history.

## Appendix 2 {#sec-dnc}

Unrighteous dominion is a phrase from the scripture Doctrine & Covenants 121:39 that describes when someone uses their authority to manipulate or control another person. It can manifest in many ways, including: Controlling behavior Making major decisions without consulting others, such as financial or employment decisions Intimidation Using shame, fear, or belittling to control someone or hold them to unrealistic expectations Abuse Physical violence, verbal abuse, or emotional abuse Withholding approval Constantly criticizing someone and withholding love or approval, making them feel like they can never please you

## Appendix 3 {#sec-d_day}

D-Day, which occurred on June 6, 1944, was a pivotal moment in World War II. Here are the key points highlighting its significance:

1.  **Turning Point in Europe**: D-Day marked the beginning of the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. The successful landing on the beaches of Normandy, France, initiated a critical phase in the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control.

2.  **Strategic Victory**: The operation, known as Operation Overlord, involved meticulous planning and coordination among the Allied forces, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other nations. It demonstrated the Allies' ability to execute large-scale amphibious assaults.

3.  **Deception and Surprise**: The Allies employed extensive deception tactics (Operation Bodyguard) to mislead the Germans about the invasion's location, contributing to the element of surprise and reducing initial resistance.

4.  **Massive Scale**: D-Day was one of the largest amphibious military assaults in history, involving over 156,000 Allied troops, 5,000 ships, and 11,000 aircraft. The sheer scale of the operation underscored the Allies' commitment and resources.

5.  **Opening a Western Front**: By establishing a Western Front, the Allies forced Germany to fight a two-front war, significantly stretching its resources and weakening its defensive capabilities on both the Eastern Front (against the Soviet Union) and the Western Front.

6.  **Liberation of France**: The successful landings led to the liberation of Paris and eventually all of France, boosting the morale of the Allied forces and the occupied populations in Europe.

7.  **Accelerating the End of the War**: D-Day accelerated the downfall of Nazi Germany. Within a year of the landings, the Allies advanced into Germany, leading to the eventual surrender of Nazi forces in May 1945.

8.  **Human Cost and Heroism**: D-Day highlighted the immense human cost of war, with thousands of soldiers killed, wounded, or missing in action. It also showcased extraordinary acts of bravery and heroism, symbolizing the sacrifices made for freedom and the fight against tyranny.

Overall, D-Day was a crucial event that significantly influenced the outcome of World War II, contributing to the defeat of Nazi Germany and shaping the post-war world order.
