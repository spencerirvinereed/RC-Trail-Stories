Met regulars on the trail.

Saw two older gentlemen towards the end of the hike.

Said quick hello and was ready to move on.

They stopped.

One gentleman, Mike Maher asked,

>Where are you from?

That opening question again.

The usual answer^[https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20240111%20From%20Whence/], 

>Originally from Korea

He related how he converted a co-worker, while working at Grand America.

Noticed the other person wasn't talking much and he was wearing a t-shirt that had a temple logo.

>What temple is on your shirt.

>Washington DC

>I lived in Maryland, where did you live?

>Olney,

>By chance do you know, my brother in law?

>Yes I was his Stake President.
