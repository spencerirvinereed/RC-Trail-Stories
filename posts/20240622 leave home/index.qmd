집떠나면 고생. (Leave Home, Hardship(困難))

An often quoted saying, yet I regularly chose to accept and bear – when young.

Now that I am older, I am more deliberate in choosing to leave home.

Comparing whether the benefits of seeing a new places, and tasting new cuisine, outweigh the inevitable hardships of travel.

Waiting in lines, anxiety of missing a scheduled flight, new and less than comfortable housing.

> 젊어서 고생은 사서도 한다 It's okay to go through hardships when you're young.[^1]

Though we often forget, when we leave our physical home, we are faced with discomfort, trials and challenges.

Hence all of the travel related blogs.

We have no recollection of leaving the spiritual or heavenly home. What can be expected when leaving the spiritual home.

If we want comfort we stay home

Vacation by GoGos

Can't seem to get my mind off of you\
Back here at home, there's nothin' to do\
Now that I'm away, I wish I'd stayed\
Tomorrow's a day of mine that you won't be in

When you looked at me, I should have run\
But I thought it was just for fun\
I see I was wrong, and I'm not so strong\
I should have known all along that time would tell

A week without you\
Thought I'd forget\
Two weeks without you and I\
Still haven't gotten over you yet

Vacation, all I ever wanted\
Vacation, had to get away\
Vacation, meant to be spent all alone

Vacation, all I ever wanted\
Vacation, had to get away\
Vacation, meant to be spent all alone

A week without you\
Thought I'd forget\
Two weeks without you and I\
Still haven't gotten over you yet

Vacation, all I ever wanted\
Vacation, had to get away\
Vacation, meant to be spent all alone

Vacation, all I ever wanted\
Vacation, had to get away\
Vacation, meant to be spent all alone

Vacation, all I ever wanted\
Vacation, had to get away\
Vacation, meant to be spent all alone
