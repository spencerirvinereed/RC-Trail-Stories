The Olympic Torch went through Koreatown.

A colleague asked if I was watching the Paris Olympic.
I told him no, and he proceeded to tell me some highlights and how his family is gathering to watch the Olympics

Had he asked **why** I am not watching, I would have told him.

Because the Olympics have strayed from its ideals.
Specifically the money has overtaken and taken the soul out of it
