Pants felt lighter than normal.

One side was missing a normal component.

It was my cellphone.

I was using it to navigate to an unfamiliar neighborhood.

Had a time to go back and grab it.

I decided against it.

I was having an enjoyable conversation with someone I hadn't seen in years.

Plus I wanted to see if I can stay off the technology for at least an hour or two.

The event venue was in the upper avenues of the SLC.

Evening view was something I wanted to capture.

Trade off having the full moment to enjoy vs. capturing few shots that professionals would capture anyhow.

Not having a distraction meant that I could focus on the conversation.

Not having the digital interface meant I needed to wait for the digital uploads until I got home or tomorrow.

I was bit uncomfortable at first. But I did it
