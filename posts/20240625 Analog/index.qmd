**손자/孫子**

Could you check my work Grandpa?

**Older Me**

What is it you are holding, is it a paper?

I haven't seen those in a while.

**손자/孫子**

We are asked to write a 2500-word paper on the rise and fall of the smart phone era.

**Older Me**

If I remember correctly the peak was around the 20th anniversary of that device introduction. Beginning with my generation people began to cut back on the use.

By the way, submitting papers now days doesn't involve humans, correct? It is conceived by the machine, written and graded by the machine.

**손자/孫子**

Exactly, that is why I want to submit my paper on actual paper and have you introduce some analog-type errors for me. All of the machine generated papers are nearly indistinguishable.

**Older Me**

You want me to make it sound more human-like. When did this trend begin?

**손자/孫子**

It's what Syndrom character said from that vintage movie, something like.

> when everyone is special, no one is.

All outputs, including papers have the same quality -- it is perfect.

It is unnatural, monotonous and people are seeking something fresh, imperfection.

**Older Me**

I remember when digital music format and digital camera sensors replaced analog music and analog films.

The quality was in analog's favor early but the digital format caught up fast.

People began to compare and take sides.  
Digital vs Analog, but they are different and complementary technologies.

Moreover, that should not be the main discussion topic.

Instead the consequential factors are convenience and capacity.

**손자/孫子**

That is right, I have seen your analog collections.

Please elaborate on the convenience and capacity comment.

**Older Me**

This world is defined by finite capacities.

Matters are identified, cataloged, manipulated or processed and final products are made.

For instance, before digital cameras and phones with digital camera functions, there were analog films.

It came in a roll of 24 or 36 exposures.

Plus, you had send the film away to be processed.

So you didn't know the results for days.

Digital representations seem to be beyond those limitations and offer vastly improved conveniences.

**손자/孫子**

So, what is exactly wrong with having the convenience and unlimited storage capacity.

Isn't that a plus?

**Older Me**

As long as there are constraints in place.

Either self imposed, peer influenced, or society mandated.

Nature obeys order, there are regular finite hours in a day.

The days are counted in weeks and months.

Not only order but all natural things remind us that in this world, the nature is finite.
It is constrained and we humans learned how to adapt and thrive.

The digital formatted world says, there are no limits and one should indulge.

**손자/孫子**

I see what you are getting at.

An automated, solar synchronized smart phones that turn on and off according to sunlight, would be nice.

However, in the absence of such device, we need to develop both time and place limitations for all of electronic conveniences.

**Older Me**

That would be my recommendation.

Plus, having a conversation like this without the influence and omni-presence of man-made intelligence is healthy for the soul.

**손자/孫子**

Thanks much Grandpa, I am going to change my paper.

I am going to summarize our discussion today and submit it.

It will be the most analog, authentic paper
