After a dinner, a guest commented,

> You have maintained the best traits of 2 cultures.

He was being a good guest, paying a compliment to the host.

But in case he meant it, wondered,

> what are the values of 2 cultures, 
one that was I born into 
and the one I grew up in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was preparing for an overseas assignment, 2 decades ago, I came across this article.

![](images/american_value_english_1.png){width="50%"}

I didn't pay much attention to it at the time. I was busy getting ready for the role.

Recently I came across the full article [on-line](https://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Values-Americans-Live-By.pdf).

The article was written by L. Robert Kohls, who^[from the opening paragraph of https://sacredheartnorfolk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Values-of-American-Cultures.pdf]

> ... was the former director of training for the United States Information Agency where he wrote books for both Americans living abroad, and foreigners coming to America. A native of Iowa and a Korean War veteran, he and his wife moved to Korea in 1953 and founded a Mennonite orphanage, grade school, middle school and high school. Later he returned to the United States where he taught classes on comparative religions and world cultures. Sadly he passed away in 2006.

Robert opens with this,

> Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by. They have never given the matter any thought. (and) ...their belief that every individual is so unique that the same list of values could never be applied to all, or even most, of their fellow citizens.

I have not yet met a person that displayed all 13 values. 
However, during my years of living in America, I have observed that, "...as a group, Americans value these traits as positive and lives by them."

## U.S. Values

1.  Personal Control over the Environment
2.  Change
3.  Time and Its Control
4.  Equality
5.  Individualism/Privacy
6.  Self-Help
7.  Competition
8.  Future Orientation
9.  Action/Work Orientation
10. Informality
11. Directness/Openness/Honesty
12. Practicality/Efficiency
13. Materialism/Acquisitiveness

At the end of the article, Robert offers this contrast between the young, experimental nation of America vs. a more established, traditional country.

## Either OR And

During the years I was adjusting to life in America, I didn't think much about the old culture of my parents.

Nor did I think about continuing or preserving that way of life.

Looking back as well as looking forward, I am glad that I experienced dual culture. 
[Minus those years of adjusting, as a teenager.] 

Dual culture has meant an added insights, a knowledge, and a foundation.

Starting as an intersection $\bigcap$ and growing into an union $\bigcup$ of good things in both cultures.

Recently, a neighbor dropped off a 8.5 by 11 inch printout of the following,

> 9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;   

> 10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

Thank you people of Korea, United States and the Household of Faith
