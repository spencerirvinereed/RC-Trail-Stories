After a dinner, the guest said,

> You have maintained the best of 2 cultures.

He was being a good guest.

But in case he meant it, what are the values of 2 cultures that I grew up and born into.

When I was preparing for an assignment overseas, the coordinator at HQ sent me this via FAX.

I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.

1 Peter 2:9-10

9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
