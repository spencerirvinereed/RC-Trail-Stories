Tried to connect remains and envision the stairs connecting floors before it was torn apart.

What was once a 3 story temple, now resembled a double humped camel lying down.

What was once the lowest, biggest round spire sat between 2 remaining part of the temple.

A man approached and said, he was at the dedication of the temple.

That was over 50 years ago.^[9 February 1972, <https://www.thechurchnews.com/almanac/temples/provo-utah/>]

Remarked,

> you must have been a toddler

"No, I attended as a Bishop, I am 82 years old"

He looked 15 to 20 years younger than his age.

Unlike me, lamenting the loss and second guessing the decision to demolish and rebuild the structure, he was optimistic and look forward to the new temple

He served a Western Mexico Mission with our neighbor, F. Gomez.
He is from El Monte, Los Angeles.  
Close to the area of my mission.

When he was a Bishop there was only one Spanish speaking Ward. 
Now, 50 years later, there are over 40 congregations in the Utah County.

He also recounted his time at the BYU International Studies.
In 1990 he was called to serve on the Young Men General Board^[https://www.thechurchnews.com/1990/4/28/23261841/new-board-members-enoc-q-flores/]

## Antique vs Vintage

Generative AI states,

> An antique is an item that is at least 100 years old, while a vintage item is typically between 20 and 100 years old. The term "true vintage" refers to items that are at least 50 years old. 

Although the term antique and vintage are items such as housewares and accessories, the term antique and *true vintage* can serve as marker to indicate an age of man-made items, including edifices.

According to above definitions following temples are antiques.^[https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/temples/chronology/]
(Years since Dedication, As of 2024)

- 1877 (147) - St. George Utah 
- 1884 (140) - Logan Utah
- 1888 (136) - Manti Utah
- 1893 (131) - Salt Lake Temple
- 1919 (105) - Laie Hawaii
- 1923 (101) - Cardston Alberta

Following would be considered *true vintage*

- 1927 (97) - Mesa Arizona
- 1945 (79) - Idaho Falls Idaho
- 1955 (69) - Bern Switzerland
- 1956 (68) - Los Angeles California
- 1958 (66) - Hamilton New Zealand
- 1958 (66) - London England
- 1964 (60) - Oakland California
- 1972 (52) - Ogden Utah
- 1972 (52) - Provo Utah
- 1974 (50) - Washington DC

Of the *true vintage* temples, or any other temples built in the modern era, only Ogden and Provo have been demolished and rebuilt.

Although it can be speculated, it appears that the remaining *true vintage* will be updated rather than rebuilt from the ground up.

## To rebuild and start-over

The original Provo Utah took 2 years and 5 months to complete.^[https://www.thechurchnews.com/2022/2/9/23218910/provo-utah-temple-history-future-renovation-redesign-50th-anniversary/]

- Ground Breaking, 15 September 1969
- Dedicated, 9 February 1972

It is estimated to take 4 years for the new temple to be built.^[source to be confirmed]

Whereas, the demolition began in earnest on the 18 April 2024 with the removal of the Angel Moroni.

By the time, Hermano Flores and I met on 17 May 2024, the former edifice, Provo Utah Temple, was no longer.

The demolition phase was complete and the work was transitioning to clearning the debris phase.

This spring, in particular in May, the weather seemed cooler and wetter.
On an emotional level, perhaps heavens were weeping a bit for this structure as well.
Or pragmatically, the moisture was sent to minimize the dust and other particles that were being generated

I am grateful that I met E. Flores so that we can visit and learn how the Lord has guided him.
Also that I can learn from his enthusiasm for the change and improvement to temples around us.

Thank you, Provo Temple for serving the community of Provo and the Utah Valley for the past 52 years.

Grateful for the memories created, because there was a temple nearby.
