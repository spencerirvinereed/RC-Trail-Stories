Tried to connect how the stairs was before it was torn apart.

What was once a 3 story temple, now resembled a double humped camel.

What was the lowest, biggest spire sat between 2 remaining part of the temple.

A man approached and said, he was at the dedication of the temple.

That was over 50 years ago.\^\[9 February 1972, <https://www.thechurchnews.com/almanac/temples/provo-utah/>\]

Remarked,

> you must have been a toddler

"No, I attended as a Bishop, I am 82 years old"

He looked 15 to 20 years younger than his age.

Unlike me, lamenting the loss and second guessing the decision to demolish and rebuild the structure, he was optimistic and look forward to the new temple

He served a Western Mexico Mission with our neighbor Fernando Gomez.

When he was a Bishop there was only one Spanish speaking Ward. Now, 50 years later, there are over 40 congregations in the Utah County.
