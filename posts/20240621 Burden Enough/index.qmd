Tried to tell my father that there are newer or easier ways.

He would listen but he would not try the new, simpler way.

This used to frustrate me.

Now that I am older, I am beginning to understand why he chose to reject new ways and stay with old and less efficient approach.

There is a cost in switching - not only relearning but to be vulnerable.

Specifically, to appear less knowledgeable or less capable.

Dad liked to work on the car himself.

He took care of them, until electronic control unit (ECU) replaced many of discrete functions.

Nowadays, I no longer think of opening the car hood to see what may be wrong.

Maintaining the car involves changing the fluids and tires by specialists, at a given interval.

And hoping that the designers and assemblers did their best and the car will out last me.

Taking the less traveled option, the one that required more work, benefited my father.

My father knew how to get things done through work.

He could out work most people, well into his later years.

Doing the work gave him insights into machinery, mechanical and electrical among others.

He learned about the human nature by spending time working together or observing others work.

All these things gave him confidence and allowed him to be independent and ultimately â€” free.

Some questions for my generation.

-   How much of the work should be done by yourself, Make or Buy?

-   What would you do with the extra time afforded by hiring others to do the work?

-   We may have more free time than previous generations but are we more free?

Once I told my father,

"you know there is an easier way to get it done"

My father answered, in effect.

>I know there is another way that is easier, but this approach suits me and it is the one I have chosen and will stay with it

I am grateful for my parents for teaching me by example.

My mother, for showing me what is possible in this life and in the after life.

Keeping our focus heavenward.

My father for helping me firmly grounded in reality and not be afraid to take on new and difficult tasks.

I miss their wisdom and courage.
