Live those dreams
Scheme those schemes

Relax Lyrics, Frankie Goes to Hollywood

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
.....
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

On some weekends, while trying to stay sleep, I wonder,
Is it a weekday or a weekend.
Do I need to get ready for work or can I continue to relax and be lazy.

The bigger question as I approach that magical age.

How will I occupy my time
Will I be needed

Manis Friedman quote
