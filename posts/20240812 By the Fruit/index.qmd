Lately, influenced by various SNS (Social Networking Services), it seems that by viewing a few seconds or minutes of a event, one can not only get the gist but gain the feeling of participation.

However, the idea of `life-via-highlights` should not be compared to and can never replace the actual experience of attending a meeting or the place of work.

The difference is the interaction with a human being cannot be duplicated by the current technology.

Nor should it be.

Recently attended a meeting of a neighborhood

All of the attendees lives no more than a mile from another.

As described in Mosiah Chapter 2, 
Young and old were grouped into the family.

Families came and sat as a group and stayed.
Even though the meeting lasted over 2 hours.

Kudos to the young people that attended.
It is a challenge for even the adults.

The race of life seems to favor the swift, knowledgeable or powerfully connected.
Based on my experience, the winners of the race are the ones that can pace themselves and treat out of the ordinary events and normal occurrences of life.

That is they don't react and go about their lives in most ordinary, normal manner.
If the task seem especially difficult or challenging they call on their co-workers and family.
If the task is indeed extra-ordinary, then the Lord is called.
