## Longing for Home: An Invitation to Return

A period in the northern hemisphere, between the autumn equinox and the winter solstice, is a time of gathering, festivities, reflection and renewal

The moon seems more omnipresent in the early morning hours and in the early evening. 
Our minds and hearts are filled with an anticipation of reunion with loved ones and buoyed by the realization of blessings received and goodness of mankind -- despite trials and challenges that beset us all.
  
Within the church, it is a time of reunions and of spiritual revivals, the General Conference and a Stake Conference, other spiritual festivities.

Although it can be a time of joyous gathering and a celebration of accomplishments, it also remind us of “what may have been”

Advancements in technology and increased accessibility has enabled “staying-in-touch” a matter of  trade-off with our given time for one-self or an investment in friendship.

Through emails, social media, phone calls, I have visited with friends and acquaintances in Singapore, HK, Japan, Texas, and West Jordan in recent days.

After briefly catching up on our careers, we inevitably talked about our health, families, and how enjoyable our time spent together was.

What about missed opportunities, that promotion, or an increase in salary.

Little to none.

Instead we renewed our friendship.

Looked forward to and promised to one another the next in-person meeting.

Confirmed within our minds and hearts the inherent goodness of human beings.

It is a struggle to balance and make sense of idealized recollections of the past, persistent challenges of the present, and the uncertain yet promising future

## Going home

That I have felt and given love from others in this life.  

I hope to give that same love back to those that are familiar as well as those that will become familiar.

The sun that fades and recedes in Western US returns and gives its brilliant luminance to those in the Far East.

I hope to better understand and live the words written by 4th Century poet, Táo Yuānmíng (陶淵明), 365  ~ 427 CE.

What and where is our home?

歸去來兮
田園將蕪胡不歸		
旣自以心爲形役	
奚惆悵而獨悲

悟已往之不諫
知來者之可追
實迷塗其未遠
覺今是而昨非


歸去來兮(귀거래혜)  자, 돌아가자.
田園將蕪胡不歸(전원장무호불귀)  전원이 장차 황폐해지려 하는데 어찌 돌아가지 않으리.
旣自以心爲形役(기자이심위형역)  지금까지는 고귀한 정신을 육신의 노예로 만들어 버렸다.
奚惆悵而獨悲(해추창이독비)  어찌 홀로 근심하고 슬퍼만 할 것인가.
悟已往之不諫(오이왕지불간)  이미 지난 일은 탓해야 소용 없음을 깨달았다.
知來者之可追(지래자지가추)  앞으로 바른 길을 좇는 것이 옳다는 것을 알았다.
實迷塗其未遠(실미도기미원)  길을 잘못 들어 헤맸지만 그리 멀리 온 것은 아니니
覺今是而昨非(각금시이작비)  지금에야 지난날의 삶이 그릇됨을 알았다.

As with any polite invitation, we are to bring nothing but yourself, the very best of ourselves.
