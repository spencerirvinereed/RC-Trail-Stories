My father turned 44 on February, 1974.\
My mother celebrated her 42nd birthday on February, 1974.

By 29 April 1974, they would both leave their home country and start their 2nd life in America.\
My father spoke some English, having worked side by side with Americans for nearly 2 decades.

My mother knew some basic expressions.

Learning a second language, Japanese, at an early age helped them learn the language.\
However, starting a new life at 40 must have been a challenge.

They were veterans of war, experienced a communist takeover, and knew firsthand scarcity due to communal practice and effects of war.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growing up, I have had some reservations about setting aside a day of remembrance.

The experience was not positive.

It had devolved into a ritualistic burden.

It may have helped if I knew something about the person that we were remembering.

According to Wikipedia,

> Memorial Day (originally known as Decoration Day) is a federal holiday in the United States for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. 

> Many people visit cemeteries and memorials on Memorial Day to honor and mourn those who died while serving in the U.S. military. Many volunteers place American flags on the graves of military personnel in national cemeteries. Memorial Day is also considered the unofficial beginning of summer.

My parents were not veterans in the US military.  
Although my father served alongside the US Armed Forces during the Korean War.

We are beneficiary of the US and United Nations forces that came and preserved freedom.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Forces_in_the_Korean_War?oldformat=true]

Therefore, joining with others in America, we recall and celebrate the lives of those that sacrificed for the nation.

As well as those that taught us, loved us and sacrificed for the family.

And when we remember them we also remember their fortitude in life and steadfastness in Christ.\
Thinking about them lifts our burdens and we feel less lonely.

That we will build a place, that we will call home, and make a stand, as they did.

Like many before, they came seeking and establishing a better opportunity for future generations.  Knowing, like Moses of old, they will not fully participate in the offerings of the new Promised Land.

They brought with them the knowledge and traditions of their mothers and fathers.  
The fiercely independent yet loving, the people of Northern Korea.

This was their land of promise and we will make it a reality.

By serving the God of this land, as they did.[^1]

[^1]: Ether 2:12, Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.

Through their toil and love, we earned,

-   Religious conviction, anchoring on the gospel of Jesus Christ, as a family
-   Economic stability and freedom to pursue, options for their posterity
-   Educational and knowledge expansion leading to opportunities for their children.

They did it all without murmuring.

I am certain that they had dreams or aspirations that were not fulfilled in this life. 
Me and my siblings along with Mom and Dad's posterity will continue to work on those dreams.

We are blessed to carry on their name.

In doing so, we can take part, as they did, in building the Kingdom.

> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.[^2]

[^2]: Matthew 5:16
