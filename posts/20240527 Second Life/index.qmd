My father turned 44 on February, 1974.  
My mother celebrated her 42nd birthday on February, 1974.

By 29 April 1974, they would both leave their home country and start their 2nd life in America.  
My father spoke some English, having worked side by side with Americans for nearly 2 decades.
My mother knew some basic expressions.

Learning a second language, Japanese, at an early age helped them learn the language.  
However, starting a new life at 40 must have been a challenge.
Even though, they were veterans of warfare, revolution, and scarcity.

During a Mother's Day talk, our EQ President said,

"My mother stated",

> Why are there only one day set aside to remember mothers.

We are not confined to the Memorial Day to remember those that have passed on.  
However, joining with others in America, we recall and celebrate the lives of those that taught us, loved us and sacrificed for us.

And when we remember them we also remember their fortitude in life and steadfastness in Christ.  
Thinking about them lifts our burdens and we feel less lonely.

That we will build a place, that we will call home, and we will make a stand, as they did.

Like many before, they came seeking and establishing a better opportunity for future generations.
Knowing, like Moses of old, will not fully participate in the offerings of the new Promised Land.

This was their land of promise and we will strive to make it a reality.

By serving the God of this land, as they did.^[Ether 2:12, Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.]

Through their toil and love, we earned,

- Religious freedom, anchoring on the gospel, as a family
- Financial stability and freedom for their posterity
- Educational expansion leading to opportunities for their children.

They did it all without murmuring.

I am certain that they had dreams or aspirations that were not fulfilled in this life.
Me and my siblings along with Mom and Dad's posterity will continue to work on those dreams.

We are blessed to carry on their name.

In doing so, we can take part, as they did, in building the Kingdom.

> Let your light so shine before men, 
that they may see your good works and 
glorify your Father in heaven.^[Matthew 5:16]
