A long time neighbor, Professor Peter C. passed away last week.\
When we moved into the neighborhood, 20 years ago, there were well over 50 people in the group, consisting of older men that met on Sundays.

Peter consistently sat in the back row.\
The further away from the teacher, the more likely you will get a tangential yet insightful, memorable comments. Peter and others ensured that happened regularly.

The topic was

> "Do unto others as you would have them do unto them."[^1]

[^1]: Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets, Matthe7:12

Understand and serve from our vantage point or POV.

However, Peter responded,

> Do unto others as they wish to be do unto them.^[this is author's words, Peter said it more eloquently and succinctly]

Understand the need and provide service without considering our own needs.\ 
The `Golden Rule` can have varied meanings and applications

## Needy vs Needed

Rabbi Manis Friedman's responded to this question,[^2]

> ,,,the purpose for their life?

"The first thing is you have freedom of choice. And the choice you need to make is a very simple one.

You can be needy. (or) You can be needed.

You can focus on your needs, try to satisfy your needs, pursue your needs... and you're gonna get depressed.

Or you can focus on who needs you.

That's who we are. We are necessary."

## A Leader among Us

At a young age, he surprised us by his thorough understanding and expressing and writing his thoughts with ease.

It is said of Jesus,

> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.

-   NIV, Luke 2:46-47

For He

> increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

Some are born with a foundational understanding of the eternal order. Practicing these principle for the benefit others.

He understood the Golden Rule from the needed person's perspective. Loved and cared for others as they need to be cared and loved.

> Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

Thank you Spencer.
