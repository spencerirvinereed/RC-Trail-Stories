They were kind but informed us that not much personal information was kept and is now available
Especially if the rank was a private.

Most casualty yet least recognition.

D-Day, commemoration of the start (25 June 1950) and the signing of the armistice (17 July 1953) is celebrated each summer.

However, our father left us with his own account

After about 6 months of fighting only my father and another person was left, that wasn't killed or injured in his group of about 100 fighting men.

He said he was involved in major battles of the Korean War.
He retreated along with the other members.
But fought along the east coast during the fight back

He passed along 금강산

## Captured 3 times : escaped 3 times

Third time, he escaped by hiding behind on the north side, instead of the south side.

나이는 좋은대 시대를 잘못만났다.


It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses.
