귀환 vs 귀한

Lessons learned during hotel stay and checkout.

We stay for a while and call it a home.

Someone would take our place and call it their own.

The difference is the length of stay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Met the hotel staff that will clean up after me.

She was far more advanced than me in refinement.

Not tainted by the things of this world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After checking out felt briefly homeless.

Knowledge of having a home somewhere.

A place of shelter, rest and renewal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about our heavenly home.

How do we find out way home.

Is there a map, a guide

Different feeling when we have a physical home, spiritual home.

When we know how to return home.
