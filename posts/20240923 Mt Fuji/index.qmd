Like to meet the person(s) that coined the phrase,

一度も登らぬ馬鹿、二度登る馬鹿

Commonly translated as,

>A wise man will climb Mount Fuji once. Only a fool climbs it twice

Alternatively,

>Unwise not to climb Mount Fuji once. Unwise to climb it twice.

Nearly always agree with proverbs, but this one is a challenge.

- Why is it foolish to return to a favorite place?
- Is the author suggesting, avoid hazards and over-reaching?
- Life to is too short to cling to only one place?

## Professor DeVerl and Y-Mountain

A university after retiring, and after 3rd back surgery, decided to climb a nearby Y-mountain^[a 8,568 feet or 2612 meters, Mt. Fuji is 3776 meters or 12,930 feet].
A 3,500 foot climb, during spring, summer, fall, and even during winter.
He did this every month.

[Deseret News Account](https://www.deseret.com/2001/6/19/19592169/tall-peak-can-t-tire-retiree/)

When the article was written in 2001, he was pushing 70, and he had climbed the peak, every month for over 7 years.

He stated then,
>It's just a matter of attitude and determination,

He would continue in this endeavor until his passing in 2020.
His obituary states,

>...Some will know him as the Y-Mountain Man due to his 300+ consecutive monthly hikes to the top of Y Mountain; a goal that took him 25 years to complete!

My EE professor was not unwise.

## Oblique reference to 7 deadly sins

According to Wikipedia, The 7 deadly sins in Christianity are pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth. 

Unwise man, who is slothful, is advised to become more active and climb a nearby mountain.

And a warning to do not do things to its excess, especially food and drink.

Perhaps the author foresaw our day and was cautioning against the pervasive use of passive entertainment.

Without interacting with nature and often in isolation from others.

Satisfy the curiosity, catch up on the latest developments, but do not become entangled or get mentally worked over.

## Personal Interpretation

I like stability and predictability, most of the time.
However, there are times, I rather hike another location than the same one I hike each morning.

That is not to say that my hike is same.
Each day, the canyon, in partnership with things terrestrial and celestial, brings different sensations and measures of times and seasons.
Each season, the canyon is made over, a new color, moisture, lighting - a complete renovation.

In return, my mind and body respond differently.

Thereby a new thought, a new feeling is formed.

## Conclusion

Want to thank the writers of that Mt. Fuji proverb.
For prompting, encouraging and questioning my motives.

I want to set a goal to achieve and work towards climbing `Mt. Fuji` of our lives, as they suggested

However, I will depart from their second advice.

I will continue to return to the place of inspiration and challenge.
For the goal, challenge and the reward of `the climb` remains the same.

However, it is me that is transformed each time, each season the task is repeated.
