> **withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from active working life**

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retirement#:~:text=%3A%20withdrawal%20from%20one's%20position%20or%20occupation%20or%20from%20active%20working%20life)

Visiting and hiking same locale regularly has afforded new acquaintances.

Some visit on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, others daily.

Everyone have their set schedule or routine.

Some exchange greetings, others are on first name basis.

Then there are the ones we pause and visit, like Professor H.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He has taught Religious Education at a church-sponsored university in Provo.

One time he commented, some people, when they retire, get angry.

At society, at church, at themselves.

He didn't elaborate why.

## ![](m4.jpg)

My parents both worked, retiring near 70.

Mother because, her age was reduced by 3 years during the war, and because she enjoyed work.

Father, because he had the desire and ability to work a few more years.

Even so, once in a while, they both missed their work life.

That was hard to understand as a middle aged person not particularly enjoying – the active working life.

My parents were blue collar workers.

> **people who perform manual labor or skilled trades that usually don't involve working in an office**.

They were grateful to have work and to provide for the family.\
We didn't get to take vacations or have material possessions but we had something more valuable

We were taught that we had a heavenly connections and we were to separate things of this world from the things eternal.

They lived the principle taught in Mark 12:17

> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.

Perhaps they witnessed some who have,

> ... gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

Next time I saw Professor H, I asked him to elaborate.

Those that retire fall into 3 groups.

Those that are angry, disappointed and liberated.

The reason that some were angry or disappointed was that they focused on the work or the career and didn't cultivate the role of life, the one that will endure.

Beyond the active working life.

Thanked him and bid him a good hike.

As Sister K and I descended, we thought of the end of life of our parents. How they graduated and returned to the place of their origin.

They were liberated from this sojourn on the earth. There was a bit of disappointment on the part of those that stayed.

They knew their origin, understood and developed their roles.\
They have returned to that place where they put aside their treasures.

> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
