When traveling one of the enjoyable parts is to talk to strangers.

Taxi Cab drivers are a good representatives for their countries.

It is sad when they do not speak the universal language.


3 Drivers and their quote/advice

Taiwanese driver

> Your pronounciations are horrible, too high and too fast. Please speak low and slow.

Singaporean driver, good English speakers

> we want to leave this open air zoo, but where will we go, we are tied to the feeders

Korean driver

> your ears are more sensitive than your eyes.  Don't get caught up in the perpetual desire to upgrade your audio gears.

Have I followed any of their advices.

Still struggling with Mandarin.
Still longing to upgrade with another gadget.
Unable to shake the grasp of those that feed me.
