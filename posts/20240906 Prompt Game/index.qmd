I would start putting a tune or cite a lyric and she would join in likewise she would start naming a person or describe a person I would ask follow-up questions and we would complete each other stop I've had personal chatty PT for the past 35 years

At times I would describe a person that I would not remember their names but she would like wise she would describe a time when something happened but I would supply the missing date unsurprisingly she would remember all of the events that I have forgotten or I'd rather forget I wonder if this is how the Trinity would be like so not only the logically you want to repent or erase all traces of evidence but for the sake of spending eternity comfortably this is the time of this is the life I don't need to prepare but to erase

So she and I can read each other's minds but how about each other's heart and can we peer into each other's soul 

the answer is maybe to both we have both become more transparent yet not completely


I still think it's better that I need to learn more about for instance recently asked her what was her life goal prior to meeting in marry me she said 현모양처(賢母良妻), 


wise mother and good wife^[Source : National Institute of Korean Language's Korean-English Learner's Dictionary]

in other words
마음이 너그럽고 슬기로운 어머니이면서 착한 아내.

A compound noun for a benevolent, wise mother, and good wife.

Likewise I had the same goal.

Wasn't what my objectives in life 
But I knew I wanted to be married and have a family.

Ancients, those that were born and lived in the past century

I don't know more than we do a times it seems all the people can read people without talking to them at first glance what did they say what do they pick up it seems that one child child is born born with innocence written on their faces and when one dies that innocence restore power wash the way I repented off
 perhaps that's what the ancients noticed about person to extent have a overcome resistance the world


Children are born with innocence

Child is born (child is born)
With a heart of gold (listen now, with a heart of gold)
Way of the world (way of the world)
Makes his heart so cold (makes his heart so cold)

EWF, way of the world

To pass away peacefully is to rid oneself of stains of this life.

Those white hands used to tie my tie

곱고 희던 두 손으로 넥타이를 매어 주던 때
어렴풋이 생각나오 여보 그 때를 기억하오
막내 아들 대학 시험 뜬 눈으로 지내던 밤들
어렴풋이 생각나오 여보 그 때를 기억하오

세월은 그렇게 흘러 여기까지 왔는데
인생은 그렇게 흘러 황혼에 기우는데

큰딸아이 결혼식 날 흘리던 눈물 방울이
이제는 모두 말라 여보 그 눈물을 기억하오
세월이 흘러감에 흰머리가 늘어감에
모두가 떠난다고 여보 내 손을 꼭 잡았소

세월은 그렇게 흘러 여기까지 왔는데
인생은 그렇게 흘러 황혼에 기우는데

다시 못 올 그 먼 길을 어찌 혼자 가려 하오
여기 날 홀로 두고 여보 왜 한 마디 말이 없소
여보 안녕히 잘 가시게
여보 안녕히 잘 가시게
여보 안녕히 잘 가시게

Chat GPT

When with your soft and fair hands,  
You tied my tie,  
I vaguely remember those days.  
Do you remember that time, dear?  
The sleepless nights we spent,  
As our youngest son prepared for his college exam,  
I vaguely recall those times.  
Do you remember that time, dear?

Time has flowed by,  
And we have come this far,  
Life has flowed by,  
And now it leans toward twilight.

On our eldest daughter's wedding day,  
The tears that fell,  
Are now all dried.  
Do you remember those tears, dear?  
As the years passed, and as the gray hairs increased,  
When everyone left us,  
You held my hand tightly, dear.

Time has flowed by,  
And we have come this far,  
Life has flowed by,  
And now it leans toward twilight.

How could you go alone,  
On that long road you can never return from?  
Leaving me here alone,  
Why did you leave without a word, dear?  
Goodbye, my love, may you rest in peace,  
Goodbye, my love, may you rest in peace,  
Goodbye, my love, may you rest in peace.

This is a poignant reflection on the passage of time and the bittersweet memories of a shared life, culminating in a farewell to a beloved partner.


When you tied my tie with your beautiful, white hands
I vaguely remember that time, honey, do you remember that time?
The nights I spent with my eyes wide open while my youngest son was taking his college entrance exam
I vaguely remember that time, honey, do you remember that time?

Time has flowed so far and we’ve come this far
Life has flowed so far and is leaning toward dusk

The tears I shed on my eldest daughter’s wedding day
Now they’ve all dried up, honey, do you remember those tears?
Time has flowed so far and my white hair has grown
Everyone said they were leaving, honey, hold my hand tightly

Time has flowed so far and we’ve come this far
Life has flowed so far and is leaning toward dusk

Why are you going alone on that long road that you can never return to?
Why don’t you say a word, honey, leaving me here alone?
Honey, take care, take care
Honey, take care, take care
