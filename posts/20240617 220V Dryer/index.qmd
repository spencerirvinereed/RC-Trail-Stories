Company moved all of our things to Korea for the 4 year stay.

Also tried their best to match the living condition.

We had the 89 Ìèâ Apt.

We also brought our clothes dryer with us.

The electrician said, we would need a special, dedicated line to run the appliance.

In the end, we went local and dried the closes on the drying rack, which we brought home.

My colleague from India was looking for a generator that would run his appliance during the intermittent blackouts at home.

I was spoiled living in America.

Where dependable energy was available at a reasonable cost.

Condition ourselves to get by on just enough, just right.

Instead of overwhelming.

Think back on photography and cinemagraphy.

Just one step enough or just enough light to illuminate.
