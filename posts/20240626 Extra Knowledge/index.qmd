Old people have a way to see things.

They know things

Like Zuege Liang of old

he was able to control the rather predict the weather

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it that we are returning to?

We are born pure.

The life adds extras that we don't need.

Then our job is to recognize and remove

The ancients looked for and if they didn't find it.

Declared it good.

Old people made judgments based on one's countenance.

They could read one's attitude, their lives even by the face.

Look for signs of worldly tainted experiences.

As EWF said in the ways of the world song

a child is born with a heart of gold

ways of the world make his heart grow cold.

resist labels that constraint

no longer that person we were decades ago, or years ago.

Not even weeks or days ago
