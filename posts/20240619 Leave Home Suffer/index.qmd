> 집떠나면 고생
>

An often quoted saying

We left our original home.

There are many, nostalgic song about one's hometown.
I have no illusions about where I was born.

33 십정동 in northern part of 인천시 

Working class neighborhood.
Recollections of going to church.
We walked everywhere.
And it seemed, we were always cold, even during summer time.

Recall going to the 화랑 교회.
As we went over the 고개 
Sounds of wild animals could be heard.

Went to church with family.
But looked forward to Easter and Christmas
Not because, we understood its significance but due to treats.

Now I go because I have a better understanding of the gospel.  With or without treats

고향의 봄

이원수 작사・홍난파 작곡
1절
나의 살던 고향은 꽃피는 산골
복숭아꽃 살구꽃 아기 진달래
울긋불긋 꽃대궐 차리인 동네
그 속에서 놀던 때가 그립습니다

2절
꽃동네 새동네 나의 옛고향
파란 들 남쪽에서 바람이 불면
냇가에 수양버들 춤추는 동네
그 속에서 놀던 때가 그립습니다

돌아가시다
귀환(返回,帰還)
