> We left our original home.

There are many, nostalgic song about one's hometown.

고향의봄

나의 살던 고향은 꽃피는 산골 복숭화꽃 살구꽃 아기 진달래 울긋불긋 꽃 대궐 차리인 동네 그 속에서 놀던 때가 그립습니다

꽃 동네 새 동네 나의 옛 고향 파란 들 남쪽에서 바람이 불면 냇가의 수양버들 춤추는 동네 그 속에서 놀던 때가 그립습니다 냇가에 수양버들 춤추는 동네 그 속에서 놀던 때가 그립습니다

**Spring in My Hometown**

When spring comes to my hometown, the mountain becomes green, the river becomes green, and my heart also becomes green.

When flowers bloom in the field, cuckoos cry and butterflies play. Ah, I want to go to my hometown.

Where I played as a child, I miss the springtime of my hometown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no illusions about where I was born and raised. 
33 십정동 in northern part of 인천시. Next to present day 백운역.

It was and is working class neighborhood.

When I was young it was a semi-permanent refugee camp, like many other neighborhoods in Korea, after the war. 
Some were built with the remnants of US Army surplus items

Like the Tokyo scene after the war, from the **Gozilla: Minus One** movie, each year our lives improved.

## Memories of my first home: 

We walked everywhere. And it seemed, we were always cold, even during summer time.

Recall going to the 화랑 교회. As we went over the 고개, sounds of wild animals could be heard.

Went to church with family. Especially looked forward to Easter and Christmas, Not because, we understood its significance but due to treats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Married Sister K without meeting her parents. One year after we were married, we visited Korea.

Was introduced to her immediate family in 대전 area. Able to meet here extended family in 온양 and 아산

Within 아산 is an area known as 뱀밭[^1]

Sister K's family has been in the area for generations.

Many of the households are related. Got to sleep in the old style house with 매미

Never been welcomed like this By marrying into the Hong family I was welcomed as their own.

What would homecoming be like for a spiritually adopted

## Build a Home Here

We build a home like the one we know. 
Where people know us, without introduction.

## Return or Going Home

Koreans have the expression 돌아가시다 귀환(返回,帰還)

> God on high Hear my prayer In my need You have always been there He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home.

I need to bring myself home with guidance from above and from those I am travelling.

My hometown where I used to live is a blooming mountain village
Peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, and baby azaleas
A village decorated with colorful flowers

When the wind blows from the south across the blue fields
A village where the weeping willow dances by the stream
I miss the days when I played there
