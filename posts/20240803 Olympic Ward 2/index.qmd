Took a while to negotiate roads that are not straight nor level, in an unfamiliar neighborhood.

Also figure out avenues and its location relative to the destination.

Then saw a couple walking towards the direction of the event locale, while looking for a parking space.

They looked familiar but wondered why they would be attending this reception.

The reception was already in progress.

The house overlooked the valley, west of the State Street and beyond.

An idyllic setting for the scheduled ring ceremony and the balance of program.

Caught up with acquaintances as the sun was setting.

The home was a northeast facing home that opens to an oversized backyard, ideal for a large gathering.

The MC was doing well and the DJ played Elvis' rendition of `Can't Help Falling in Love` as the group transitioned from the Ring Ceremony to Reception and performances.

Digital music sounded clear as the music showered upon the audience.

It was Larsens from the Edgement days.

Blessing the lives of next generation with his faithfulness
