Gomez. He is from El Monte, Los Angeles.\nClose to the area of my mission.\nWhen he was a Bishop there was only one Spanish speaking Ward. Now, 50 years later, there are over 40 congregations in the Utah County.\nHe also recounted his time at the BYU International Studies. In 1990 he was called to serve on the Young Men General Board2"

    "text": "Antique vs Vintage\nGenerative AI states,\n\nAn antique is an item that is at least 100 years old, while a vintage item is typically between 20 and 100 years old. The term “true vintage” refers to items that are at least 50 years old.\n\nAlthough the term antique and vintage are items such as housewares and accessories, the term antique and true vintage can serve as marker to indicate an age of man-made items, including edifices.\nAccording to above definitions following temples are antiques.3 (Years since Dedication, As of 2024)\n\n1877 (147) - St. George Utah\n1884 (140) - Logan Utah\n1888 (136) - Manti Utah\n1893 (131) - Salt Lake Temple\n1919 (105) - Laie Hawaii\n1923 (101) - Cardston Alberta\n\nFollowing would be considered true vintage\n\n1927 (97) - Mesa Arizona\n1945 (79) - Idaho Falls Idaho\n1955 (69) - Bern Switzerland\n1956 (68) - Los Angeles California\n1958 (66) - Hamilton New Zealand\n1958 (66) - London England\n1964 (60) - Oakland California\n1972 (52) - Ogden Utah\n1972 (52) - Provo Utah\n1974 (50) - Washington DC\n\nOf the true vintage temples, or any other temples built in the modern era, only Ogden and Provo have been demolished and rebuilt.\nAlthough it can be speculated, it appears that the remaining true vintage will be updated rather than rebuilt from the ground up.\n\n\n\n26 March 2022"
