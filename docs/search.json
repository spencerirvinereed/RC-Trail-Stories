Her son would write with brush on paper in the dark.\nWhen the light was turned on again. The son’s writing was uneven and not recognizable. Mom’s sliced rice cakes were evenly sliced.\nReturned to his studies, finished the last 7 years of his study.\nHe became one of the most celebrated scholar of his generation and beyond.\nI disappointed my mother many times by not listening or not following up on her wishes.\nI probably failed in many practical exams, not recognizing they were life’s exams. Like 한석봉’s mother, she could out perform in many ways but she always encouraged me.\nThereby fostering in me, nascent skills and made them into lifelong skills or talents.\nThe honey selling grandma visited my mother, who was expecting and in debt. “This family will prosper, and your neighbors will say,”\nShe further predicted that my father will work overseas and your finance will improve dramatically and that you will have a son, and that son will have as much as education as he desires.\nMy mother couldn’t hardly believe these words and waved them off.\nShe returned later to confirm if her predictions came true.\nMy mother treated her more kindly.\nMy father had left for Vietnam and I had been born.\nDuring college days, when I struggled through classes, I remembered those words of my mother used to tell me.\nI took comfort in knowing that my mother believed in me and that a way would be open for me to gain education and find a gainful employment.\nThat was a stretch, considering I was married, expecting a child and an employment seemed like a dream.\nThank you mom for giving me that guidance and encouragement, for it helped me through difficult times."

    "text": "Appendix 2\nThe accordion has become a popular musical instrument in North Korea due to several cultural, historical, and educational factors:\n\nCultural Promotion: The North Korean government has actively promoted the accordion as a symbol of revolutionary spirit and cultural pride. Kim Il-sung, the founding leader of North Korea, was known to have played the accordion, and this association with the country’s leadership helped elevate the instrument’s status.\nEducational System: The accordion is widely taught in North Korean schools. It is considered a practical and portable instrument that can be used to play both traditional Korean music and revolutionary songs. The government’s emphasis on music education includes making the accordion a standard part of the curriculum, ensuring that many children learn to play it from a young age.\nMilitary and Political Significance: The accordion is often used in military and political events. Its portability makes it suitable for performances in various settings, from formal ceremonies to outdoor gatherings. It has become a staple at rallies, parades, and other state-sponsored events where patriotic and revolutionary songs are performed.\nCultural Identity: In North Korea, the accordion is seen as part of the country’s cultural identity. It is featured in numerous cultural performances and is often depicted in state media as a symbol of the hardworking, joyful, and revolutionary spirit of the North Korean people.\nPropaganda Tool: Music, including accordion music, is used as a tool for propaganda in North Korea. Songs played on the accordion often carry political messages and are used to instill loyalty to the regime and its leaders.\nCommunity and Unity: The accordion is also seen as an instrument that brings people together. Group performances and sing-alongs featuring the accordion are common, fostering a sense of community and unity among participants.\n\nOverall, the popularity of the accordion in North Korea is a result of deliberate state policies aimed at promoting certain cultural values and fostering a sense of national identity. The instrument’s portability, versatility, and historical associations with the country’s leadership have all contributed to its prominent place in North Korean society."

(see, Section 1)\nIs this what you had in mind? I am glad we no longer have conflicts on the scale that your generation and previous generations experienced.\nOlder Me\nA good summary.\nI believe the root of all conflict is to assert unrighteous dominance and to take away god given freedom. (see Section 2)\nAs far as the absence of inter-national, or intra-national conflicts, I believe they are on-going and ever will be.\nAs long as people or persons want to eliminate God and family and exercise unrighteous dominion over others, there will be wars, fought physically or spiritually.\nWe are shielded from internal struggles or burdens of each generation but we will all experience these on-going conflicts.\n손자/孫子\nWhat then is our defense?\nDo we go on the offense?\nOlder Me\nLet’s read the 6th Chapter of the Epistle of Paul to Ephesians.\n10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.\n11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\n13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.\n14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;\n15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;\n16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.\n17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:\nThe arrangement of battles and its players may look different. However, the challenge has been and will be to separate the good and the evil and cling to those principles, or laws and commandments that saved other generations.\n손자/孫子\nThanks Grandpa. I am beginning to understand what you are saying.\nIt is our challenge to make old things new again. Make fresh commitments or covenants and to meet, fight, and vanquish the current brand of evil.\nAll with help from God above and following examples of past generations.\nGotta go, but what was that D-Day all about?1"

    "text": "Appendix 1\nThe 20th century saw numerous wars driven by a variety of complex factors. Here are some of the primary reasons for these conflicts:\n\nNationalism: The rise of nationalistic fervor led to aggressive expansionist policies and conflicts. This was especially evident in the Balkan Wars, World War I, and World War II, where nationalist ambitions fueled territorial disputes and ambitions for empire-building.\nImperialism and Colonial Rivalries: European powers competed for control over territories and resources, leading to tensions and conflicts in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. The struggle for colonies often resulted in confrontations and wars between imperial powers.\nIdeological Conflicts: The 20th century was marked by ideological battles, particularly between democracy, fascism, and communism. The most significant examples include World War II, where fascist regimes sought to dominate, and the Cold War, where the ideological conflict between the capitalist West and communist East led to proxy wars and significant global tension.\nEconomic Factors: Economic instability, competition for resources, and the impact of the Great Depression contributed to conflicts. Nations sought to secure resources and markets, leading to aggressive foreign policies and war.\nTreaty and Alliance Systems: Complex networks of treaties and alliances often escalated conflicts. For example, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 led to World War I due to a web of alliances and mutual defense agreements.\nEthnic and Religious Tensions: Many wars were fueled by ethnic and religious differences, leading to internal and regional conflicts. The Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s and various conflicts in the Middle East are examples where ethnic and religious divisions played a significant role.\nRevolution and Civil Wars: Revolutions and internal strife often escalated into broader conflicts. The Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, the Chinese Civil War, and numerous independence movements and revolutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America were driven by the desire for political and social change.\nTechnological and Military Advancements: The rapid development of military technology and strategies often made war more likely, as nations sought to test new capabilities and gain military superiority. This arms race was particularly evident during the Cold War, leading to various confrontations and proxy wars.\n\nEach of these factors contributed to the numerous and varied conflicts of the 20th century, making it one of the most war-torn periods in human history."

    "text": "Appendix 3\nD-Day, which occurred on June 6, 1944, was a pivotal moment in World War II. Here are the key points highlighting its significance:\n\nTurning Point in Europe: D-Day marked the beginning of the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. The successful landing on the beaches of Normandy, France, initiated a critical phase in the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control.\nStrategic Victory: The operation, known as Operation Overlord, involved meticulous planning and coordination among the Allied forces, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other nations. It demonstrated the Allies’ ability to execute large-scale amphibious assaults.\nDeception and Surprise: The Allies employed extensive deception tactics (Operation Bodyguard) to mislead the Germans about the invasion’s location, contributing to the element of surprise and reducing initial resistance.\nMassive Scale: D-Day was one of the largest amphibious military assaults in history, involving over 156,000 Allied troops, 5,000 ships, and 11,000 aircraft. The sheer scale of the operation underscored the Allies’ commitment and resources.\nOpening a Western Front: By establishing a Western Front, the Allies forced Germany to fight a two-front war, significantly stretching its resources and weakening its defensive capabilities on both the Eastern Front (against the Soviet Union) and the Western Front.\nLiberation of France: The successful landings led to the liberation of Paris and eventually all of France, boosting the morale of the Allied forces and the occupied populations in Europe.\nAccelerating the End of the War: D-Day accelerated the downfall of Nazi Germany. Within a year of the landings, the Allies advanced into Germany, leading to the eventual surrender of Nazi forces in May 1945.\nHuman Cost and Heroism: D-Day highlighted the immense human cost of war, with thousands of soldiers killed, wounded, or missing in action. It also showcased extraordinary acts of bravery and heroism, symbolizing the sacrifices made for freedom and the fight against tyranny.\n\nOverall, D-Day was a crucial event that significantly influenced the outcome of World War II, contributing to the defeat of Nazi Germany and shaping the post-war world order."

    "text": "This weekend was the semi-Annual Conference of the Provo Sharon East Stake.\nInitially, thought of going out of town for the weekend. Instead, we visited Park City and Salt Lake City. We stayed home and attended both General Sessions.\n\n\n\nSunset near the Stake Center\n\n\nThe topic for the Saturday evening session was gathering. Specifically the Gathering of Israel.\nPresident Kelly Reeves took the stand at 7:45PM. We all wondered how he will speak for 45 minutes. We were hoping this would be a short session.\nInstead, President Reeves took the Q&A approach.\nHe had asked members ahead of the meeting to share their experiences in gathering. Members responded, and sent him their experiences in photos and in the written format.\nIn addition, President Reeves asked members to clarify aspects of gathering. Members were eager to share their experiences. Microphones were passed all around the chapel.\nPeople were engaged and were lifted.\nThe meeting ended around 8:30PM as plannned.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln stated, “It is fitting and proper…” that we celebrate significant events in our lives and at country level.\nBut maybe the challenge is to elevate everyday experiences so that we are not stretching or reaching for the next level, that these events are meant to teach.\n\nMorning session began as light drizzle came down, amidst more sunshine than clouds.\nGreater part of the stake members were in the MSB (Multi-Stake Building) on 9th.\nThe speakers and ones that gave prayers were represented by both young and old.\nA deacon aged young man provided the opening prayer. Similarly a young woman, formerly Laurel group, gave the closing prayer.\nThe speakers represented major age groups of the stake.\nSister Quinn, aged 86, gave her talk while sitting in her wheelchair. While she spoke, one could see both Olivia and Joaquin, framed in the background. Jeanne spoke eloquently and with strength, both Olivia and Joaquin follwed the talk from the beginning to the end.\nA display of enduring to the end.\n\nMeeting opened with changing of Stake auxiliary leaders.\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Group\nReleased\nCalled\n\n\n\n\nPrimary\nThornock\nWilkey\n\n\nYoung Women\nCraig\nHaight\n\n\n\nA thought, as the meeting passed the 90 minute mark. Long meetings are a challenge to even old members. Then how about these young members?\nIf they endure well, they will have that much more advantages in later life. Not so much what they heard and will remember, but why they came to the meeting and stayed with their families.\n\nAnd it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another. |\n\n(Mosiah 2:5)\nThe technology that overcomes the constraint of time and space. The people in the overflow, Stake Center, heard and saw events and people as they occurred.\n\nFormer BYU President and also the former Stake President Kevin Worthen spoke. Years of his service had aged him physically, his hair was completely white. However, his voice and the manner of delivery was nearly the same, even when he led the Stake 20 years ago.\nRemembered those times when we met at the old Provo Tabernacle. We would sit on the balcony and look down. Stake leaders were adorned with leis, made by faithful, tradition-loving stake members. President Mike Middleton, spoke of Citius, Altius and Fortius. In particular the feat of Bob Beamon, who broke the long jump record by nearly 2 feet.\n\nBeamonesque\n\nPresident Seamon, taught members how to mourn together. Not taking the cup away but staying awhile with those that mourn.\nStake President Reeves closed the meeting with the dual nature of worshipping. It may seem repetitive but when you add people, each experience becomes unique.\nThis is a model of a Stake of Zion. Members live in a close proximity, known by one another. The division or boundary between the church and the school is small and thin.\nBy participating and uplifting one another, till the end, the young members are seeing and learning the Lord’s way of navigating this life.\nFull dependence on the Lord and at the same time, do all within our ability.\nAs President Toronto liked to state,\n\nBe yoked together with Christ."

Her subjects were modernized, Korean themes. She had recently moved to LA, Koreatown from NYC.\nShe was introduced to us by a Sister from NYC, that owned an ice cream shop near West 3rd Street and Normandie.\nWe would visit her regularly and she was cordial. At times, we weren’t sure who was teaching and who was learning. She certainly had more knowledge and experience.\nWe stayed inside during the night hours. But we could hear the sound of guns and would often see police helicoptors with a search light fly overhead.\nAlso there were many grafitti markings where we walked.\n\nSo when she made the comment about the state of the world, I wondered what would be the right response.\nI didn’t have any.\nNow, nearly 40 years later, I have a greater appreciation of the remark but still no satisfying answer.\n\nThe surprising movie from last year was Gozilla Minus One It had engaging story telling and attractive, relatable casts.\nIn addition, the post WW2, neighborhood scene transition from a temporary housing to a more semi-permanent brought back memories.\nMy parents lived through the Korean War as a 20-year-old soldier and as an 18-year-old eldest daughter of a fatherless family.\nAfter the War, their living conditions must have beeen like the one from the Godzilla movie.\nWithin 10 years from the end of the Korean War, 3 children would join the family.\nMy parents followed this, the first commandment given,\n\nAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it:…\n\n\nKorean proverb says,\n\n아이들은 자기 먹을 것 가지고 태어난다\n\nLiterally, Children are born with their own food. Alternately, Children are born with the means to survive in this world.\nI would like to meet Sister C and her children again and see how their lives turned out. Also thank my parents were bringing my sisters and I into this world at a time when most temporal items were scarce and hope for the future was slim.\nLeaving us an example of how to overcome the trials in this life.\nThey put their trust in God who created all things and promised us\n\nPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."

    "text": "Appendix : 김장 (Kimjang)\n김장 (Kimjang) is the traditional Korean practice of making and preserving kimchi, an essential part of Korean cuisine.\n\nKimjang: A Millennial’s Guide to a Timeless Tradition\nWhat is Kimjang? Kimjang is a communal activity where families and communities come together in late autumn to prepare large quantities of kimchi for the winter. This tradition is deeply rooted in Korean culture and has even been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nWhy Kimjang? - Seasonal Necessity: Before modern refrigeration, Koreans used to preserve vegetables for the long, harsh winters. Kimchi, made from fermented cabbage and radishes, provided essential nutrients during these months. - Community Bonding: Kimjang is more than just food preparation; it’s a social event. Families and neighbors gather to share the labor, recipes, and stories, strengthening community ties.\nThe Process of Kimjang 1. Preparation: Fresh ingredients like napa cabbage, radishes, garlic, ginger, and red chili pepper flakes are gathered. The cabbage is salted to draw out moisture and ensure a crisp texture. 2. Mixing: A spicy paste made from chili pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, and often fish sauce or salted shrimp is prepared. This paste is then mixed with other ingredients like radishes and green onions. 3. Stuffing and Packing: The salted cabbage leaves are coated with the spicy mixture and then packed tightly into jars or traditional Korean earthenware pots (onggi). 4. Fermentation: The kimchi is left to ferment, which can take a few days to a few weeks, depending on the temperature and desired flavor.\nWhy It Matters Today - Cultural Heritage: Participating in Kimjang is a way to connect with Korean heritage and history. - Healthy Eating: Kimchi is a superfood rich in vitamins, probiotics, and fiber, promoting gut health and boosting immunity. - Sustainability: Making kimchi at home reduces food waste and reliance on store-bought products, which often come with excess packaging.\nModern Kimjang Today, while some still follow the traditional methods, many have adapted Kimjang to fit urban lifestyles: - Community Centers and Workshops: Urban dwellers often gather at local community centers or attend workshops to make kimchi together. - Small Batches: With limited space, many people make smaller batches of kimchi more frequently throughout the year. - Innovative Recipes: Millennials experiment with new ingredients and flavors, incorporating vegan or gluten-free options.\nBy participating in Kimjang, millennials can enjoy delicious, homemade kimchi while honoring a practice that has sustained Korean families for generations. Whether in a small apartment or a community kitchen, Kimjang continues to be a cherished tradition, bringing people together in the spirit of sharing and preserving food."

Me and my siblings along with Mom and Dad’s posterity will continue to work on those dreams.\nWe are blessed to carry on their name.\nIn doing so, we can take part, as they did, in building the Kingdom."

    "text": "Growing up in Korea after the war meant nearly all things were scarce.\nAccording to my uncle, per capita GDP following the Korean War was around 100 USD.\nAI Overview,\n[$67 in 1953 is worth $786.81 today]\nIn those days, there were many things one could wish for but never attain.\nAnd there were few items that were within reach but never get enough of.\nTwo of those were milk and green bananas.\nThe bananas were in short supply and they were always green and expensive. I didn’t realize the natural or ready to eat color of bananas were yellow until I came to America.\nNor did I get to find out the taste of it while in Korea.\nWe had a bottle of milk delivered to our home, when I began school.\nThe milk came in a 12 ounce bottle and 3 of us found creative ways to divide the content.\nThe contested and divided milk was savored.\nWished for a time when milk and bananas can be had in abundance.\nThere is a noodle shop in West Valley where many Koreans congregate.\nI see many people that are my age and older.\nHowever, I also see the next generation and their friends as well.\nThe daughter of the owner commented that I know many that visit the store.\nLike visiting a local supermarket, I meet at least one person I know when I visit.\nI belong to that group of Koreans that still remember times when food was scarce and that eating out meant a significant financial burden, an occasion to celebrate and escape, realities of a survival living.\nEating out meant Korean-Chinese restaurant.\nThey served several dishes but most people order one of 2 dishes.\n짜장면1 and 짬뽕2\nBecause these noodles were part of a special occasions, during growing up years, eating them now brings back those memories.\nFirst bite reminds or triggers memories of difficult days growing up and helps me realize how far we have improved.\nNow days these dishes are consumed not only for its taste but for nostalgia and sentimental reasons.\nI live in a place that is flowing with milk and honey3.\nAs well as any other food that mankind has deemed desirable.\nBasic needs, ones I dreamt about in Korea, have all been met.\nWhen young, I resisted my parents’ advice and their style of living.\nI remember asking my mother, how she survived the Korean War.\nShe said,\nShe would further comment that these planes would fly low and the pilot would tilt the wings from side to side to get a better view the target.\nI recall, bags lined up next to us, when we landed in Anchorage, Alaska for the immigration process.\nWe started a new chapter with less than 10 checked bags.\nI don’t know how much they were able to bring on their escape from the North. link\nMost likely less than the checked bags we had, on that flight to Alaska and on to Washington DC.\nDon’t know how, but my parents made us feel like we were well off - even when an average person earned few hundred dollars a year.\nIn many ways, my parents fortified us against 2 sources of adversities.\nPoverty and Wealth.\nThey showed how to live in times of plenty, cautiously.\nAs well as in times of war induced famine, courageously.\nAs recorded in Helaman 5,\nIt is now my generations turn to live and teach so that,"
