Sounds one can hear and also feel. In the morning, the canyon feels as if a chilled oxygen tank has been opened.\nThese seemingly same or similar scenes, gradually transforms persons. As a person takes a step forward and upward, it seems to remove or empty terrestrial items.\nThe emptied mind is replaced with recollections of the past, appreciation for the people in one’s life, and a hope in the change that will make one complete or whole."
