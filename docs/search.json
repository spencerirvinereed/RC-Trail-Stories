As a person takes a step forward and upward, it seems to remove or empty terrestrial items.\nThe emptied mind is replaced with recollections of the past, appreciation for the people in one’s life, and a hope in the change that will make one complete or whole."

    "text": "Appendix : 김장 (Kimjang)\n김장 (Kimjang) is the traditional Korean practice of making and preserving kimchi, an essential part of Korean cuisine.\n\nKimjang: A Millennial’s Guide to a Timeless Tradition\nWhat is Kimjang? Kimjang is a communal activity where families and communities come together in late autumn to prepare large quantities of kimchi for the winter. This tradition is deeply rooted in Korean culture and has even been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nWhy Kimjang? - Seasonal Necessity: Before modern refrigeration, Koreans used to preserve vegetables for the long, harsh winters. Kimchi, made from fermented cabbage and radishes, provided essential nutrients during these months. - Community Bonding: Kimjang is more than just food preparation; it’s a social event. Families and neighbors gather to share the labor, recipes, and stories, strengthening community ties.\nThe Process of Kimjang 1. Preparation: Fresh ingredients like napa cabbage, radishes, garlic, ginger, and red chili pepper flakes are gathered. The cabbage is salted to draw out moisture and ensure a crisp texture. 2. Mixing: A spicy paste made from chili pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, and often fish sauce or salted shrimp is prepared. This paste is then mixed with other ingredients like radishes and green onions. 3. Stuffing and Packing: The salted cabbage leaves are coated with the spicy mixture and then packed tightly into jars or traditional Korean earthenware pots (onggi). 4. Fermentation: The kimchi is left to ferment, which can take a few days to a few weeks, depending on the temperature and desired flavor.\nWhy It Matters Today - Cultural Heritage: Participating in Kimjang is a way to connect with Korean heritage and history. - Healthy Eating: Kimchi is a superfood rich in vitamins, probiotics, and fiber, promoting gut health and boosting immunity. - Sustainability: Making kimchi at home reduces food waste and reliance on store-bought products, which often come with excess packaging.\nModern Kimjang Today, while some still follow the traditional methods, many have adapted Kimjang to fit urban lifestyles: - Community Centers and Workshops: Urban dwellers often gather at local community centers or attend workshops to make kimchi together. - Small Batches: With limited space, many people make smaller batches of kimchi more frequently throughout the year. - Innovative Recipes: Millennials experiment with new ingredients and flavors, incorporating vegan or gluten-free options.\nBy participating in Kimjang, millennials can enjoy delicious, homemade kimchi while honoring a practice that has sustained Korean families for generations. Whether in a small apartment or a community kitchen, Kimjang continues to be a cherished tradition, bringing people together in the spirit of sharing and preserving food."
